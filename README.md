# Intro to Network Devices (part 1)
- Layer 1 devices
	- Physical Layer
- Layer 2 devices
	- Data Link
- Layer 3 devices
	- Network

---
**Layer 1 Devices:**

- Analog Modem
	- 
	- Were developed to take the digital signal coming from a digital node and convert it to an analog signal (Wire)
	- Developed to also create connections between network segments via PSTN(Public Switched Telephone Network) using POTS(Plain Old Telephone System)
	- They provide for a SINGLE connection to a network
	- "Modulator/Demodulator"
	- Only concerned about the WIRE
	- Resides on Layer 1 (Physical Layer) of OSI Model
		- "Doesn't care where the signal comes from. Just does its job!"
- The Hub
	- 
	- Functions as a concentrator/repeater
		- "Doesn't care where signal comes from or where it's going!"
	- Takes electrical signal that arrives on a port and replicates that signal out all of the other ports
	- Few ports/many ports
	- "Not very common in modern networking"
---
**Layer 2 Devices:**

- Switch
	- 
	- Utilizes ASIC(Application-specific Integrated Circuit) chip!
	- The ASIC chip has specific programming that allows the switch to learn when a device is on the network and which parts it is connected to via device's Layer 2 MAC address
	- Few/many ports
	- Can be very simple/highly complex and programmable
	- Will only communicate with local network devices!
- Wireless Access Point (WAP)
	- 
	- Specific type of network bridge that connects ("bridges")
		-  Wireless network segments with wired network segments
	- Most common WAP Bridges:
		- 802.11 Wireless Network Segments with 802.3 Ethernet Network Segments
	- Only communicates with local network devices!
---
**Layer 3 Devices:**

- Multilayer Switch (MLS)
	- 
	- Provides normal Layer 2 network switching services, but also provides Layer 3 or higher OSI model services
	- Most common MLS is a Layer 3 switch
		- Utilizes ASIC chip for switching and is programmed to handle routing functions
		- Allows device to communicate and pass data to non-local network devices
	- Highly programmable and complex network device
	- Few/many ports
	- "Too expensive for small offices & home office networks"
		- Mostly used by Enterprise Local Area Networks
- Router
	- 
	- MOST common network device for connecting different networks together utilizing OSI model's L3 logical network information
	- Uses software programming for decision making as compared to the switch's ASIC chip
	- Uses this programming to keep track of different networks and what it considers to be the best possible route to reach those networks
	- Can communicate with BOTH local and non-local network devices!
	- In most cases it has fewer ports than a switch
